# here lies a simple CRUD app.
### This repository exists for learning and testing purposes just so i can figure out how to use git, github and other programming stuff on a regular basis. All criticism is valid. Well, if you somehow manage to find this repo. 
### UPDATE: i decided to rewrite my previous app based on fiber framework to a default http and etc. libraries. main.go is deprecated, look for new_main.go for now
